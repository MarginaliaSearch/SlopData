/** SlopTable is a utility class for managing a group of columns that are
 * read and written together.  It is used to ensure that the reader and writer
 * positions are maintained correctly between the columns, and to ensure that
 * the columns are closed correctly.
 * <p></p>
 * To deal with the fact that some columns may not be expected to have the same
 * number of rows, SlopTable supports the concept of column groups.  Each column
 * group is a separate SlopTable instance, and the columns in the group are
 * managed together.
 * <p></p>
 * It is often a good idea to let the reader or writer class for a particular
 * table inherit from SlopTable, so that the table is automatically closed when
 * the reader or writer is closed.
